	More and more autonomous vehicles are entering traffic. This has been an incentive to research the effects on the flow of traffic of self-driving cars joining their human-steered counter parts, most notably by \citeauthor{dresner2007sharing}. However, as far as we could find, all simulations in this area propose significant changes in infrastructure. Although changing infrastructure may make sense in the future if autonomous cars become more commonplace currently it is quite unlikely that policy makers will invest in changed infrastructure. 

	Our simulation aims to quantify some of the effects of the ratio human driven vehicles to autonomous cars on the flow of traffic. We expect the flow of traffic to improve as the number of self-driving cars increases relative to the number of `normal' cars. \todo{Our simulation has proved our expectation\ldots}. \algemeen{Natuurlijke overgang naar de relevance, volledig negerend dat het abstract daarmee ingeleid is.}
