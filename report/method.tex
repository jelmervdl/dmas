In this section we first discuss the design of our model, after which we explain the set-up of the experiments performed with the models in \cref{sub:method:design}.

\subsection{Experiment Design}
\label{sub:method:design}
To test if autonomous vehicles have an influence on traffic delays and crashes, we run the simulation multiple times, with different autonomous vehicle to human driver ratios.

For each of these runs, we measure the time it takes for each agent to reach its goal, relative to the distance they have to travel from their initial position to the target. Furthermore we keep track of the number of collisions with other agents. 

Using these measurements, we  determine if the number of collisions and the delay time are influenced by the ratio of autonomous agents to the human ones.
