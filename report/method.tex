In this section we will first discuss the design of our model, after which we will explain the design of the experiment.

To test if autonomous vehicles have an influence on traffic delays and crashes, we run the simulation multiple times, with different autonomous vehicle to human driver ratio. 
For each of these runs, we will measure the time it takes for each agent to reach its goal, relative to the distance it is from their initial position to the target. Also, we measure the number of crashes. 
Using these, we will determine if the number of crashes and the delay time are influenced by the number of autonomous agents relative to the human ones.
