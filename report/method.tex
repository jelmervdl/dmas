% Informal description
Informally our simulation defines a network of streets in which cars have to find their way from their point of departure to their destination. The behaviour of a car is completely controlled by the wish to reach its destination and to not have a collision with other cars. Depending on the type of driver of a car, the size and shape of its field of view changes. 
% Dat is het idee van de actperiod, right?
Furthermore human drivers have a higher reaction time than autonomous drivers. It should be noted that we do not model traffic rules or signs, neither do we simulate overtaking behaviour. 

\Cref{sub:method:model} presents a formal description of a model, the set-up of the experiments performed with the model are discussed in \cref{sub:method:design}.
