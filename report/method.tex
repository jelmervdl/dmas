% Informal description
Informally our simulation defines a network of streets in which cars have to find their way from their point of departure to their destination. The behaviour of a car is completely controlled by the wish to reach its destination and to not have a collision with other cars. Depending on the type of driver of a car, the size and shape of its field of view changes. The positions and velocities of the cars is simulated in a continuous way using a physics engine. 

Furthermore human drivers have a higher reaction time than autonomous drivers. It should be noted that we do not model traffic rules or signs, with the exception of the priority to the right rule. Neither do we simulate overtaking behaviour.

\Cref{sub:method:model} presents a formal description of a model, the set-up of the experiments performed with the model are discussed in \cref{sub:method:design}.
