\paragraph{Initialization}
\label{par:method:model:details:initialization}
\algemeen{How are the environment and the individuals created at the start of a simulation run, i.e. what are the initial values of the state variables? Is initial- ization always the same, orwas it varied among simulations? Were the initial values chosen arbitrarily or based on data? References to those data should be provided}

\paragraph{Input}
\label{par:method:model:details:input}
\algemeen{The dynamics of many IBMs are driven by some environmental conditions which change over space and time. All these environmental conditions are “input”, i.e. imposed dynamics of certain state variables.}
