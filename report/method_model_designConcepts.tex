\paragraph{Agents}
There are a couple differences between human drivers and autonomous agents. Firstly, the view of the human drivers is limited, compared to that of autonomous drivers. Where the autonomous drivers have a circular view in a radius of 12 meters, the human drivers have an arc-shaped view of differing radius. This radius differs per vehicle. As the drivers are built, they get assigned a \t{viewLength}. This is sampled from a random distribution with a mean of 8 meters and a standard deviation of 2. 

Furthermore, the human drivers have an \t{actPeriod} of 100 \si{\milli\second}, which means that 100 \si{\milli\second} pass between each updated step. This causes them to have a slower reaction to the environment. Autonomous drivers have an \t{actPeriod} of 0 \si{\milli\second}, which means they always react instantly. 

Lastly, the way they react to other vehicles in the neighbourhood differs. This is already explained in \cref{par:method:model:overview:process}. 

% \paragraph{Emergence} 
% % \algemeen{Which system-level phenomena truly emerge from individual traits, and which phenomena are merely imposed?}
% There are no system-level phenomena that emerge from individual traits.

% \paragraph{Adaptation} 
% % \algemeen{What adaptive traits do the model individuals have which directly or indirectly can improve their potential fitness, in response to changes in themselves or their environment?}
% The individuals have no adaptive traits.

% \paragraph{Fitness} 
% % \algemeen{Is fitness-seeking modelled explicitly or implicitly? If explicitly, how do individuals calculate fitness?}
% Fitness-seeking is not modelled explicitly. \todo[inline]{Ook niet echt impliciet toch?}

% \paragraph{Prediction} 
% % \algemeen{In estimating future consequences of their decisions, how do individuals predict the future conditions they will experience?}
% Agents are purely reactive, they do not not consider future conditions when deciding on their next action.  

\paragraph{Sensing \& Interaction} 
% \algemeen{What internal and environmental state variables are individuals assumed to sense or “know” and consider in their adaptive decisions?}
Individual vehicles can sense other vehicles and other objects if they are close enough to `see' them. They cannot see into each other's state variables, or those of the simulation. What is actual perceived by an agent depends on its type, self-driving versus human driver, and in the case of the human agent its state. 

Although vehicles can observe other vehicles and objects they cannot interact with them. Both humans and autonomous vehicles can only see other objects if they appear within that agents' field of view. The field of view of an autonomous driver is larger, and is updated more often, so they will see more.

% \paragraph{Interaction} 
% % \algemeen{What kinds of interactions among individuals are assumed?}
% Vehicles can observer other vehicles, but they cannot interact.

% \paragraph{Stochasticity} 
% % \algemeen{Is stochasticicity part of the model? What are the reasons?}
% In this simulation everything is determined, there is no stochasticity.

% \paragraph{Collectives} 
% % \algemeen{Are individuals grouped into some kind of collective, e.g. a social group?}
% There are no collectives in this simulation, all the agents function for themselves.

\paragraph{Observation} 
% \algemeen{How are data collected from the IBM for testing, understanding, and analysing it?}
The data we collect is with regard to the delay encountered while driving from one point to another, and the number of crashes. These measurements are discussed extensively in \cref{sub:method:design}.
